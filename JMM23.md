# JMM 2023
The 2023 Joint Mathematics Meetings was held in Boston, Massachusetts. A Professional Enrichment Program (PEP) titled "Introductory Python Jupyter Notebooks for College Math Teachers" brought together members of the authorship team of this classroom resource project.  The JNB "Patterns" was included as a 'hands-on' activity on the second day of the PEP.
